You can run TypeScript (TS) code in Node.js using three primary methods: a direct execution runner like tsx, native support in newer Node.js versions, or by transpiling the code to JavaScript first. 
Method 1: Use a Direct Runner (tsx or ts-node) 
This is the recommended approach for development and scripts as it allows you to run .ts files directly without a manual compilation step. 
Install a runner (e.g., tsx is often faster and has better ESM support than ts-node).
bash
npm install -D tsx
Run your file using the tsx command instead of node.
bash
npx tsx yourfile.ts
You can also use ts-node in a similar fashion:
bash
npx ts-node yourfile.ts
 
Method 2: Use Native Node.js Support (Node v22.6.0+) 
Recent versions of Node.js offer experimental native support for running TypeScript files by stripping type information on the fly. 
If you are using Node.js v22.18.0 or later, you can run erasable TypeScript code directly without any flags:
bash
node yourfile.ts
For versions between v22.6.0 and v22.17.0, use the --experimental-strip-types flag:
bash
node --experimental-strip-types yourfile.ts
 
Method 3: Compile to JavaScript, then Run 
This method is standard for production environments, as the code is pre-compiled for maximum performance. 
Install TypeScript in your project:
bash
npm install -D typescript @types/node
npx tsc --init
The tsc --init command creates a tsconfig.json file to configure the compiler.
Compile your TypeScript file (yourfile.ts) into a JavaScript file (yourfile.js) using the TypeScript compiler (tsc):
bash
npx tsc yourfile.ts
Run the generated JavaScript file using Node.js:
bash
node yourfile.js
 
Summary of Methods
Method 	Use Case	Pros	Cons
tsx	Development, scripts	Fast, simple setup, no config needed	Does not perform type checking
Native Node.js	Modern Node.js env	No extra tools/installs needed	Requires newer Node version; still experimental
Transpilation	Production	Optimized performance, full type safety	Requires a build step
